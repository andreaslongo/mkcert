= mkcert: A simple program to create X.509 certificates

== Getting started

. Download and unpack the asset for your platform from the https://github.com/andreaslongo/mkcert/releases[release page].
** *Linux*: https://github.com/andreaslongo/mkcert/releases/latest/download/mkcert-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz[mkcert-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz]
** *Windows*: https://github.com/andreaslongo/mkcert/releases/latest/download/mkcert-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip[mkcert-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip]

. Copy the program to the host where you want to use the new certificate.
+
NOTE: It is not necessary to copy and move around private keys.
You can create them directly at the target host.

. Open a terminal and run the program.

[source, bash]
----
# Linux
al@linux ~ $ mkcert -f examples/request.yaml
New certificate: csr.example.com
Enter new passphrase:
Verifying - Enter new passphrase:

al@linux ~ $ ls csr*
csr.example.com.csr  csr.example.com.key
----

[source, powershell]
----
# Windows
PS C:\Users\al> mkcert.exe --help
A simple program to create X.509 certificates

Usage: mkcert.exe [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --file <FILE>      Template file
  -b, --bundle <BUNDLE>  Bundle a private key with a certificate into a PKCS #12 file
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
----

== Private keys

A new private key is automatically generated with every request.
Each key is encrypted based on the passphrase you specify.
You can use (decrypt) the key with the same passphrase.

Details:

* Encryption algorithm: AES 256-bit CBC
* Key derivation function: PBKDF2

NOTE: Use a strong (long and random) passphrase.

== Creating PKCS #12 files

A PKCS #12 (.p12) file is convenient for handling certificates on Windows.
They contain a private key and one or more certificates.

To create a .p12 file, use the `-b, --bundle` option together with a private key and a certificate.

[source, bash]
----
al@linux ~ $ ls crt*
crt.example.com.crt  crt.example.com.key

al@linux ~ $ mkcert -b crt.example.com.key
Bundle: crt.example.com
Enter passphrase:

al@linux ~ $ ls crt*
crt.example.com.crt  crt.example.com.key  crt.example.com.p12
----

You can then double-click the .p12 file to import the private key and the certificate into the Windows certificate store.
Delete the .p12 file after a successful import.
You don't need it and the store is more secure.

== Contributing

The best way to get started is to build and run a local dev container.

You can use https://podman.io[Podman] or any other OCI compliant container manager.
The dev container has all the required dependencies for working with the project.

[source, bash]
----
container/build.sh
container/run.sh
----

From inside the container, you can then run some workflows.

[source, bash]
----
cargo test    # run tests
cargo clippy  # run linters
cargo run
